# Hybrid AI Sensor Placement Guide

This project helps you find the best places to put water quality sensors in a sewer network. It uses an "Intelligent Assistant" (AI) to learn how pollution moves through pipes and suggests where to place sensors for maximum safety.

# 1. Setup (Do this first)

If you haven't set up the software yet, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Prepare the workspace
python -m venv venv

# 2. Activate the environment
# For Windows (PowerShell):
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser # Only need to do this once
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install the tools
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> [!TIP]
> **Windows Error?** If you see an error about "scripts is disabled on this system," run the `Set-ExecutionPolicy` command shown above and try again.

## 2. Choose Your Path

What would you like to do today?

### 🟢 PATH A: Real-World Network Analysis
*Use this if you have a specific sewer network (like Example 9) and want to find where to put sensors.*

1.  **Prepare your file:** Make sure your `.inp` file is ready. If it's a long simulation (years), trim it to 24-48 hours.
2.  **Run the Analysis:** Run these commands to start the process:
    ```bash
    # 1. Create the data
    python dataset_generator.py --model_path ./dataset/Examples/Example9.inp --n_scenarios 500

    # 2. Teach the AI
    python train_models.py --model_path ./dataset/Examples/Example9.inp

    # 3. Find sensor locations
    python bdn_solver.py --model_path ./dataset/Examples/Example9.inp
    ```
3.  **See Results:** Look in the `bdn_output/results/comparison_table.csv`. This file shows the results for **XGBoost, MLP, and GNN** side-by-side so you can pick the best one.

### 🔵 PATH B: Simulation & Experimentation Lab
*Use this if you want to test the system using a built-in "test network" (Example 8) to see how the AI works.*

1.  **Generate Test Data:**
    ```bash
    python dataset_generator.py
    ```
2.  **Teach the AI:**
    ```bash
    python train_models.py
    ```
3.  **Test Sensor Placement:**
    ```bash
    python bdn_solver.py
    ```

## 3. Which "AI Brain" Should I Use?

When you run the analysis, the system uses different "brains" to think. You don't need to change anything, but here is what they are:

*   **XGBoost (The Speedster):** Very fast and good for general networks.
*   **MLP (The Thinker):** Good at finding complex, hidden patterns.
*   **GNN (The Architect):** The most advanced; it understands the physical shape of the pipes.

## 1. Purpose

This project provides the data generation infrastructure for a hybrid AI model that recommends optimal water-quality sensor placements in combined sewer networks. The core idea is to simulate a large number of contamination injection scenarios in SWMM, record which network nodes detect contamination above a threshold, and use those detection patterns — combined with static network topology features — to train an ML model.

The scientific basis follows Sambito et al. (2020), who showed that sensor placement in urban drainage can be optimised using detection probability matrices derived from hydraulic simulations.

## 3. File Inventory

### `Example8.inp`

The primary SWMM input file. Defines the combined sewer network geometry, subcatchment properties, conduit cross-sections, pump curve, dry weather flows, and rainfall timeseries. This version includes a `[POLLUTANTS]` section declaring `CONTAM` as a conservative tracer (zero decay), which is required for water-quality simulations.

### `Example8_test.inp`

An alternate version of the input file used during development and debugging. The `[POLLUTANTS]` section appears after `[INFLOWS]` rather than before it in this file — this ordering is also accepted by SWMM 5.2.

### `dataset_generator.py`

The main data generation script. See [Section 5](#5-dataset-generator-pipeline) for a full description of its pipeline.

### `feature_engineering.py`

Enriches the base node features with regulator/diversion metrics and Monte Carlo prior proxies, producing `node_features_full.csv`.

### `train_models.py`

Trains ML models (XGBoost, LightGBM, MLP, and optionally GCN/GAT) on node-level features and detection targets. Produces ML-derived prior files in `ml_output/priors/`.

### `bdn_solver.py`

Runs the Bayesian Decision Network comparison over baseline and ML priors using `raw_scenarios.csv` and `node_features_full.csv`. Writes results to `bdn_output/results/comparison_table.csv`.

### `dump/train_eval_pipeline.py`

Higher-level pipeline script that orchestrates model comparison and BDN evaluation for the repo.

### `model_registry.py`

Utilities for MLflow model registry integration, enabling model versioning, staging, and deployment management.

### `cache.py`

Caching utilities for expensive computations like network parsing and feature engineering.

### `config/`

Configuration files for different environments:

- `default.yaml` - Base configuration
- `development.yaml` - Development overrides
- `production.yaml` - Production settings

---

A sample output from a 30-scenario run demonstrating the column schema. Not the full training dataset.

### `output_sample/node_features.csv`

A sample of the aggregated node-level feature table from the same 30-scenario run.

### Additional pipeline stages

This repo also supports downstream ML and sensor-placement evaluation beyond dataset generation:

- `feature_engineering.py` produces `node_features_full.csv` with additional regulator and Monte Carlo prior features.
- `train_models.py` trains ML models and writes ML priors to `ml_output/priors/`.
- `bdn_solver.py` compares classical and ML priors and writes `bdn_output/results/comparison_table.csv`.
- `dump/train_eval_pipeline.py` provides a higher-level workflow for training and evaluation.

## 4. SWMM Network — Example8.inp

### 4.1 Network Topology

The network represents a **29-acre urban combined sewer catchment** drained by two parallel pipe systems:

- **Green pipes** — combined sewers carrying both stormwater and wastewater, routing to flow regulators
- **Brown pipes** — interceptor sewer collecting dry weather flow and conveying it to the WWTP

Flow regulation is achieved through four transverse weirs (W1–W4) and one bottom orifice (Or1), which together divert dry weather flow and small storm flows to the interceptor while allowing larger storms to overflow to the stream (O1).

### 4.2 Node Inventory

| Node ID             | Type                    | Description                                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Well                | Storage node            | Pump wet well; receives interceptor flow before pumping         |
| O1                  | Outfall                 | Stream discharge (overflow)                                     |
| O2                  | Outfall                 | WWTP discharge (pumped force main)                              |

### 4.3 Conduit Types

| Type                 | IDs            | Description                                         |
| -------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Stream conduits      | C3–C11, C_Aux3 | Open trapezoidal channels; carry overflow to stream |
| Combined sewer pipes | P1–P6          | Circular pipes; carry combined flow                 |
| Interceptor pipes    | I1–I9          | Circular pipes; carry intercepted flow to wet well  |
| Force mains          | I10–I13        | Circular pipes downstream of Pump1                  |

### 4.4 Simulation Settings

| Parameter           | Value                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Flow routing        | DYNWAVE (fully dynamic wave) |
| Routing time step   | 15 seconds                   |
| Simulation duration | 12 hours                     |
| Rainfall event      | 0.23 inches, 1-hour duration |
| Flow units          | CFS                          |
| Infiltration method | Horton                       |
| Allow ponding       | No                           |

### 4.5 Dry Weather Flows

Baseline wastewater flows are applied at five nodes as `DRY` type inflows:

| Node | Baseline flow (cfs) |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| J1   | 0.008               |
| J2a  | 0.010               |
| Aux3 | 0.004               |
| J13  | 0.0123              |
| J12  | 0.0125              |

### 4.6 Pollutant Definition

`CONTAM` is declared as a conservative tracer with zero decay, zero background concentrations, and no snow-melt quality component:

```
[POLLUTANTS]
;;Name  Units  Crain  Cgw   Crdii  Kdecay  SFflag
CONTAM  MG/L   0.0    0.0   0.0    0.0     NO
```

> **Important:** Do not add optional trailing columns (`CoPoll`, `CoFrac`, `Cdwf`, `Cinit`) after `SFflag=NO`. SWMM 5.2 misreads bare zeros in those positions as object references and raises ERROR 209 ("undefined object 0.0").

### 4.7 High-Risk Nodes

Three nodes have elevated prior contamination probability based on their network position and the findings of Sambito et al. (2020):

| Node | Reason                                                                  |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| J4   | Upstream combined sewer junction with direct surface access             |
| J10  | Downstream combined sewer junction receiving multiple upstream branches |
| JI18 | Interceptor junction at the convergence of flow regulator outputs       |

These nodes are assigned `prior_contam_prob` = 2 × baseline in `node_features.csv` and are sampled at twice the rate during scenario generation.

---

## 5. Dataset Generator Pipeline

`dataset_generator.py` runs in five sequential steps.

### Step 1 — Parse Network (`parse_network`)

Reads `Example8.inp` line by line, extracting:

- All node IDs from `[JUNCTIONS]`, `[OUTFALLS]`, and `[STORAGE]` sections
- All link connectivity pairs from `[CONDUITS]`, `[PUMPS]`, `[WEIRS]`, and `[ORIFICES]`
- Node type classification (J, JI, aux, outfall, storage)

Two graph representations are built:

- `G_dir` — directed graph following flow direction (used for topology depth and betweenness)
- `G_und` — undirected graph (used for pipe-segment distance matrix)

### Step 2 — Topology Distances (`compute_topo_depth`, `compute_dist_matrix`)

**`topo_depth`:** For each node, the shortest directed path length to the nearest outfall (O1 or O2). Computed with `nx.shortest_path_length` on `G_dir`. Nodes with no downstream path to an outfall receive depth = 999.

**`dist_matrix`:** Full all-pairs shortest path lengths on the undirected graph `G_und`. Used to populate `dist_src` in `raw_scenarios.csv` — the number of pipe segments separating the injection node from each observation node.

### Step 3 — Static Feature Table (`build_topology_features`)

Computes the following features for every node, saved to `node_features.csv`:

| Column              | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `topo_depth`        | Shortest directed path length to nearest outfall                                |
| `n_upstream_nodes`  | Number of network ancestors (nodes that can reach this node via directed edges) |
| `betweenness`       | Normalised betweenness centrality on directed graph                             |
| `downstream_paths`  | Number of distinct directed simple paths to any outfall (cutoff = 20 hops)      |
| `node_type`         | String label: J, JI, aux, outfall, storage, other                               |
| `node_type_code`    | Integer encoding: J=0, JI=1, aux=2, outfall=3, storage=4, other=5               |
| `is_high_risk`      | 1 if node is J4, J10, or JI18, else 0                                           |
| `prior_contam_prob` | Normalised prior probability of being a contamination source                    |

### Step 4 — Scenario Generation (`build_scenario_inp`)

For each scenario, the following parameters are sampled:

| Parameter      | Distribution      | Range                                            |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `src_node`     | Weighted discrete | All 28 candidate nodes; J4/J10/JI18 at 2× weight |
| `mass_kg`      | Uniform           | 0.01 – 0.50 kg                                   |
| `duration_hrs` | Uniform           | 0.25 – 3.0 hours                                 |
| `start_hrs`    | Uniform           | 0.0 – 6.0 hours from simulation start            |

The injected concentration (mg/L) is derived from mass and carrier flow:

```
conc (mg/L) = mass_kg × 10⁶ / (CARRIER_FLOW × duration_hrs × 3600 × 28.317)
```

where `CARRIER_FLOW = 0.01 cfs` is the small background flow used to physically carry the pollutant mass through the network.

A temporary `.inp` file is built from `Example8.inp` for each scenario by:

1. Injecting a `[POLLUTANTS]` section if not already present (guard for base file compatibility)
2. Appending two `TIMESERIES` entries — one for carrier flow, one for pollutant concentration — as step functions spanning the injection window
3. Appending two `INFLOWS` entries at `src_node` — a `DIRECT` flow inflow and a `CONCEN` quality inflow

The timeseries are shaped as a flat-top pulse:

```
00:00   → 0.0
pre     → 0.0        (1 minute before injection start)
start   → value      (injection begins)
end     → value      (injection ends)
post    → 0.0        (5 minutes after injection end)
12:00   → 0.0
```

### Step 5 — SWMM Execution (`run_scenario`)

Each scenario `.inp` is executed using the low-level `swmm.toolkit` C API:

```python
swmm_open(tmp_inp, rpt, out)
swmm_start(True)          # True = save results to binary output file
while True:
    t = swmm_step()       # advance one routing step (15 seconds)
    if t == 0: break
    for i, nid in enumerate(ids_order):
        c = slv.node_get_pollutant(i, 0)[0]   # CONTAM concentration (mg/L)
        q = slv.node_get_result(i, 0)          # total inflow (cfs)
swmm_end()
swmm_close()
```

Node ordering uses `slv.project_get_id(slv.swmm_NODE, i)` to retrieve SWMM's internal ordering, ensuring the index `i` passed to `node_get_pollutant` matches the correct node.

Per-node results recorded:

| Column          | Description                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `peak_conc`     | Maximum concentration observed at the node across all timesteps (mg/L)             |
| `t_peak_min`    | Time from simulation start to peak concentration (minutes); `None` if no detection |
| `mean_flow_m3s` | Mean total inflow at the node averaged across all timesteps (m³/s)                 |
| `detected`      | 1 if `peak_conc ≥ 5 mg/L`, else 0                                                  |

If `swmm_open` raises an exception (e.g. input file error), all results for that scenario are set to zeros and the scenario is counted as failed.

## 8. Known Issues and Fixes

### ERROR 209 — "undefined object CONTAM"

**Cause:** `Example8.inp` was originally generated as a hydraulics-only model with no `[POLLUTANTS]` section. SWMM raises ERROR 209 when `CONTAM` appears in `[INFLOWS]` without first being declared as a pollutant.

**Fix:** A `[POLLUTANTS]` section is now present in `Example8.inp`. `dataset_generator.py` also contains a guard in `build_scenario_inp` that injects the section into any base file that lacks it:

```python
if '[POLLUTANTS]' not in content:
    pollutants_block = (
        '[POLLUTANTS]\n'
        ';;Name  Units  Crain  Cgw   Crdii  Kdecay  SFflag\n'
        'CONTAM  MG/L   0.0    0.0   0.0    0.0     NO\n\n'
    )
    content = content.replace('[INFLOWS]', pollutants_block + '[INFLOWS]')
```

### ERROR 209 — "undefined object 0.0"

**Cause:** Including optional trailing columns (`CoPoll`, `CoFrac`, `Cdwf`, `Cinit`) after `SFflag=NO` in the `[POLLUTANTS]` line. SWMM 5.2 parses these as object references when `SFflag=NO`, treating the bare zero values as undefined object names.

**Fix:** The `[POLLUTANTS]` declaration stops at `SFflag`. No trailing columns.

### ERROR 200 / Empty `.rpt` File

**Cause:** The `QUALITY ALL` keyword was erroneously added to the `[REPORT]` section in an earlier fix attempt. `QUALITY` is not a valid SWMM `[REPORT]` keyword and causes a pre-parse failure that produces an empty `.rpt` file.

**Fix:** The `[REPORT]` section uses only standard keywords (`INPUT`, `CONTROLS`, `SUBCATCHMENTS`, `NODES`, `LINKS`). Quality output is included automatically in `NODES ALL` output when pollutants are present — no extra keyword is needed.

## 9. Extending the Pipeline

### Increasing scenario count

For a full ML training dataset, run with `--n_scenarios 5000` or more. Each scenario takes approximately 1–2 seconds, so 5,000 scenarios require roughly 2–3 hours.

```bash
python dataset_generator.py --n_scenarios 5000 --output_dir ./output
```

### Adding decay

To model a reactive contaminant (e.g. bacteria with first-order die-off), change the `Kdecay` value in the `[POLLUTANTS]` declaration:

```
CONTAM  MG/L   0.0    0.0   0.0    0.05    NO
```

Units for `Kdecay` are 1/hour in SWMM.

### Using a different network

Replace `Example8.inp` with any SWMM 5.x input file. The system is now robust and will automatically:
- Inject a `[POLLUTANTS]` section if missing.
- Append injection `[TIMESERIES]` and `[INFLOWS]` to the correct sections.
- Handle different network topologies and node names.

You may still want to update:
- `HIGH_RISK_NODES` in `dataset_generator.py` to reflect your network's high-priority nodes.
- `EXCLUDE_SOURCE` in `dataset_generator.py` to match your outfall and storage node names.

### Parallelisation

Each scenario is independent. For large runs, scenarios can be parallelised using Python's `multiprocessing.Pool`. Each worker needs its own temporary `.inp` filename to avoid file conflicts:

```python
tmp_inp = f'_scenario_tmp_{worker_id}.inp'
```
